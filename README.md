# Homework 01 - Flappy Bird

https://youtu.be/fQoJZuBwrkU


Endless scroller type of game.  


Code in subdirectory in the git repository named ***icd0006-2020s***  


## Leg 01 - Basic gameboard UI
***Deadline 2021-03-04 23:59***

Implement endless scroller gameboard animation for Flappy Bird.  
Gameboard has to be responsive to browser screen size (use full screen).  
Your board should scroll from right to left creating continous flying path through the background.  
Animate the background for 5 seconds.  
Divide your code into MVC, use OOP. Dont mix game logic and UI!  Use modules.
Look at demo made in lecture (and please listen for the explanation of HW in lecture recording).  
Code is pure JS - no additional libraries, no typescript, etc.


## Leg 02 - Finished game
***Deadline 2021-03-18 23:59***
Make the Flappy Bird fly through your generated and animated gameboard.  
Detect wall collisions - game over.  
Create leaderboard (keep track of best efforts, ask for player name).  
Flappy bird flapping would be nice!  
Code is pure JS - no additional libraries, no typescript, etc. No canvas!
Allow dynamic browser window resizing - listen to the resize event and recalculate your gameboard.
